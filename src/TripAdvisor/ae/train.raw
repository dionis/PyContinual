Orlando, we made the reservations and the staff member(Front Desk) was rude and had no interest whatsoever in me or my reservation there, trying to get information from her was like pulling teeth, but this was my first trip to Miami, and the hotel was downtown so I figured how bad could it be after all the price was right about 100.00 bucks, but I did listen to my instinct and made the reservation for only one night, and booked six nights at the quality Inn at the Falls, the front desk clerk there was great who took my reservation, the River Park when we pulled up looked like a dump in need of some serious renovations, not enough space to pull up to and check in while you take your luggage out of the car, no parking except next door in a office tower (Public ) garage, $21.00 a night, While riding back down in the garage elevator, I noticed a sign that said Hyatt Hotel Guest pay $5.00 a night or something like that, When we checked in at the front dest I asked if they had a similar arrangement with the garage and of course the answer was no.

Over the past few years, major chains such as the Grand Hyatt, Conrad (and most recently) the Ritz Carlton have opened up in Tokyo, but I am a big fan of the Japanese-style service at the Okura - honestly nothing is too much trouble, and the response time is ludicrously fast when you call for help - laundry, iron etc.

Ours had a walk in shower room- very luxurious for a 4 star and air conditioning- which we did need in Feb as hotel was a bit too hot for us.This hotel is surrounded by great little bars and resturants- stay off Santa Ana for value and is walking distance to all the other major points of interest.

Had breakfast in the restaurant on our first morning there but i didn't think it was worth the money but that was just us we didn't like the food there was and we were able to go to a juice bar or a bakery or grocers and get something far cheaper and much more to our taste.i would definately go back here again.
