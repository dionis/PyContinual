The place was fantastic in every way.Just the right mix between quality service and facilities and not being too over the top.Rooms were large, very modern and had all the latest gadgets installed - 2 Lcd tv's, multi headed shower system, usual Japanese high tech toilets, powerful air-con system, comfortable beds.I have nothing to fault this hotel on.The location was excellent for getting around, the French Kitchen on the 2nd floor did a great competitive breakfast, service was spot on, and the gym and pool facilities on the 5th floor were very well ordered and surprisingly little used on the occasions I visited them.I would definately stay here again.

They wanted over $300 for 4 days, and we ended up renting at Enterprise for about $125 insurance included ( after driving in Puerto Rico I highly recommend taking there insurance).

A family of 4 cost about $200, so your not dealing with a bunch of out of control kids running around with one adult trying to wrangle them, these people are paying very good money for the day use only of these things, and are not a problem at all.

Wages are the same, and cost of living is very high here unlike most destinations in the Carribean, so don't expect to come here and rack up on some over priced brand name purses, because everything is priced basically the same as in the states.

Oh yeah, Donald Trump is building a couple hundred condos on the same property as the resort (Don't worry, you don't even know the construction is going on, this place encompasses over 2000 acres), and Trump also has two 18 hole golf courses (PGA tour 2008-2011) on the property.

If you need to get out and roam, this is not the resort for you, as you are miles away from anything, however there is so much to do right there at the resort I can't imagine why you would need to go anywhere.
